# 🌾 AgriYield Predictor – AI-Based Crop Yield Prediction System

An AI-powered web application that predicts **crop yield** using soil and environmental parameters and recommends the **best crop to cultivate**.  
The project integrates **Machine Learning (AI/ML)** with **Web Development** to create a real-world agricultural decision-support system.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

AgriYield Predictor helps farmers and agricultural planners make data-driven decisions by predicting crop yield based on inputs such as:

- Nitrogen (N)
- Phosphorus (P)
- Potassium (K)
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Rainfall
- pH value

The system also recommends suitable crops and visualizes yield predictions using **bar graphs** for better understanding.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Predict crop yield using Machine Learning regression models  
- Recommend the most suitable crops for given soil & climate conditions  
- Provide an interactive and user-friendly web interface  
- Combine AI/ML with web technologies for real-world impact

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow

1. **Dataset Collection**
   - Crop, soil, and environmental datasets from Kaggle / FAO sources

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values  
   - Feature scaling using StandardScaler  
   - Encoding crop labels  

3. **Model Training**
   - Regression-based ML model  
   - Model saved using `joblib`  

4. **Prediction**
   - User inputs passed from UI  
   - Model predicts yield and recommends crops  

5. **Visualization**
   - Horizontal bar graph showing yield for each recommended crop
